This program has been made to help me while drawing, to ease the process of viewing references images while maintaining drawing space.
Turns out its very useful for every-day PC stuff too; managing the file explorer when moving around files comes to mind.
This to say that the following lines will talk with drawing in mind.

---#-Usage example: ---</b>
- Put your drawing program full screen, press F1 on a window with an image to keep it on sight. 
- Open up blender, load a 3D model, set the stage, adjust a weapon angle etc... Open drawing program, lower opacity with F2, now you can trace.
- Other way around works too, draw something, put blender on top, lower its opacity, now you can do the 3D adjustments stuff while seeing the drawing; now switch back to the drawing program, adjust the opacity, and trace.
- Set your browser window as "anchor" with F3, go on youtube, watch a video, you see something cool to draw? Press WIN+SPACE to quickly pause it, now draw it.
Or go on an image site with a lot of images, with WIN+ARROW you can scroll / go to another image without losing the pen touch.
If all else fails, WIN+Z will bring the window to focus while holding the Z key, this way you can click buttons, or move the window around, saves you some clicks.
- Sometimes arrow keys are annoying to press, with ALT+W/A/S/D you can emulate them.
- Your mom enters the room? WIN+X -> CTRL will minimize the current active window.
